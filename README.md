**Step 3:** Download the .zip file from releases and extract. 

**Step 4:** Open the program and set up the options as desired.

* **Confidence level:** How sure the program has to be to read a character (The lower the more characters are possible to read, but more chances of incorrect. The higher the number means bigger chance of reading correctly, but also a chance it will not read at all)
* **Key to stop program:** Which key to press to manually pause the program
* **Delay:** How much time in seconds to wait before attempting to read the next phrase
* **Speed:** Either normal speed or lower reading speed
* **Pause program when reading:** Whether or not the program stops when reading. (If it stops, it might behave weirdly until it stops reading a phrase, if not, it might read multiple at the same time)
* **Voice:** Which voice and language to use

**Step 5:** On the main tab, click "Start" and move the mouse to the indicated positions. To stop the program, just press "Stop" when running
